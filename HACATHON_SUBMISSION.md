Solana PrivacyHack 2026 - Submission
Project: Solanica Finance PRVT
Track: Open Track + Privacy Tooling 

Repository: https://github.com/solanicafinance/

Philosophy
We believe financial privacy is a fundamental human right—as essential as freedom of speech and assembly.

"Privacy is not about having something to hide. Privacy is about having something to protect."

Read our full philosophical background: PHILOSOPHY.md.

How It Works
ShadowWire Flow (Bulletproofs):
Stealth Transfer:

One-time stealth addresses
Bulletproof range proofs
ElGamal encryption
No link between sender/recipient
Privacy Modes:

Stealth: Maximum privacy, one-time addresses
Mixed: Balanced privacy/cost
Public: Minimal privacy, lowest cost.
